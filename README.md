<div align="center">A little cheesy motivational thing I wrote because someone told me I'm "not inspiring enough", and for some reason I took it half-seriously and actually kinda like the outcome.</div>

Scripting is hard to learn, but in the end it will be all worth learning it. It has given me a lot of funny and great memories.

Your first try doing something probably won’t be the best, but it is just a small step towards a bigger achievement you can reach in the future

Perfection is unreachable, impossible, an undefined word with no purpose but to give people a hard time.

Scripting is a language that can open up someone’s mind, express themselves with lines of code and taking problem solving to a whole new level. It isn’t easy, but never fuss or quit, it is worth all of the memories and fun.

**I am terrible at markdown, this took me literally 20 minutes to write. Thanks to @.csqrl for the help, as well as the social icons!**
